The 501st Legion was under Skywalker's command during the war effort, with his "first-in-command" often being Clone Captain CT-7567, who was also known by his nickname "Rex." While at first Rex needed to adapt to his maverick Jedi General because of the Clone Captain's by-the-book and no-nonsense nature, Rex would come to admire, and even would sometimes emulate, Skywalker's willingness to bend the rules and genius for improvisation, and Skywalker and Rex would even become friends.

The Venator-class Star Destroyer Resolute served as his personal flagship, under the admiralty of Wullf Yularen.[17][59] During the war, Skywalker cut the B1 battle droid R0-GR down on a number of occasions. Years later, after R0-GR met C-3PO and learned the protocol droid had been built by Skywalker, he thought this fact practically made him and the 3PO unit family.

At some point before he received a scar over his right eye, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Arantara. During the battle, Rex was wounded and rendered unconscious. After being found by Skywalker, Rex was surprised to see that he had come back for him, as acts like that were not extremely common amongst the Jedi. Skywalker responded that it should have been him in his place, telling his captain that a true leader always led from the front.
