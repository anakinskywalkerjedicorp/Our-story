Sometime later, the Jedi Council sent Skywalker along with Kenobi and Jedi Master Plo Koon along with their respective battalions to the besieged planet of Hisseen in order to stop a Separatist victory on the planet. While protecting a village from oncoming droid forces, the clones required backup before Skywalker, Kenobi, and Koon arrived to rescue them. The three jumped into combat as Koon used the Force to push several droids into one another, destroying them. After a short battle with the droids, the Republic emerged victorious over that wave of droid forces. With this, Skywalker deactivated his lightsaber and met with Clone Marshal Commander CC-2224 "Cody," Clone Commander CC-3636 "Wolffe," and as well as Clone Captain Rex regarding the Hisseenian parliament as well as a Hisseenian premier who was to meet with Count Dooku and Asajj Ventress, which could potentially lead to Dooku dissolving the government on Hisseen and allow him to control the planet.




With that, Kenobi informed the clones that they would need to hold that position while the three went after Dooku and Ventress. With that, the three Jedi left to confront Dooku and Ventress. Meanwhile, Rex told a story about him and Skywalker during a mission on Benglor. Eventually, the three managed to find Dooku, leading Skywalker to enter a duel with him while Koon contacted trooper CT-4860 requesting immediate aid. As Skywalker and his fellow Jedi chased Dooku and Ventress, they received a distress call from Rex, leading to the Jedi breaking off their pursuit to help their soldiers. Upon rescuing their clones, it was clear the day had been won for the Republic because the soldiers had rescued the Hisseenian parliament from Dooku's droids. Skywalker and his allies then departed Hisseen to return to Coruscant.
