As he grew, Skywalker's exceptional skills made him cocky, but he nevertheless idolized Kenobi, thinking there was "no one better" than his master. Having given up his life with his mother and lost Jinn, Skywalker clinged to his master, not wanting to lose him; throughout his first year as a Padawan, he had a habit of sleeping on the floor next to Kenobi's bed, wanting to ensure his mentor would not vanish in the night. Kenobi sometimes awoke at night and saw this. During one of their many adventures, he also rescued Kenobi after he fell into a nest of gundarks.

Shortly after becoming Kenobi's Padawan, a surge in overwhelming emotions shut Skywalker off from the Force entirely. This was able to give Skywalker temporary relief from his worries and fears for a time but he soon realized that avoiding the Force was not the answer and he reconnected to the Force.

During his time as Kenobi's apprentice, Skywalker was distrustful of teachers who corrected him, wondering if they were trying to help him or simply put him in his place, knowing that many had not wanted him trained in the first place. Even so, there were many Jedi who had faith in him, seeing his potential. Skywalker and Kenobi were at one point joined by Jedi Master Shaak Ti for a complicated mission to Naran-Shiv.

In addition to struggling to control his emotions, he found it hard to make friends, as his fellow Padawans were all aware of the rumors of him being the Chosen One. Often lonely, he generally spent his free time in his quarters tinkering with machinery he found in trips outside the Jedi Temple. He also harbored a lingering resentment regarding the fate of his mother.
