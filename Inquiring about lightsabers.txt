Some time after his and his masters mission to Carnelion IV, Skywalker and Kenboi were about to spar in the Jedi Temple training grounds when Anakin asked his master why the Jedi use lightsabers as opposed to any other weapon powered by kyber crystals. Upon hearing this question, Kenobi used the force to take Skywalker's weapon and told him how when he was young, Kenobi had the idea for two short lightsabers to be connected by a chain. Upon revealing this tidbit to his apprentice, Kenobi told him the same thing Qui-Gon Jinn had told Kenobi; that weilding a lightsaber shows intent and that the user put thought behind weilding the weapon before drawing it, enforcing the idea that Jedi are protectors as opposed to destroyers.
